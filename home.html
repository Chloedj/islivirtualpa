                        <p>"I’ve been working with Jo for 4 years now and she’s been a huge part of raising my business from a small firm to an exciting and thriving business. She’s been an excellent PA from the very outset and her positive can-do approach, balanced with her grounded and calm nature has been fundamental to me whilst we grow a business through changing and sometimes challenging times. 
                        It’s often natural to look towards bringing secretarial and PA roles in house once a company grows to a certain level, but Jo has become such a valued and important member of our team that we will not be wanting to go that way for a very very long time yet! 
                        Jo has a wide skill set and a firm but friendly approach which is needed sometimes when dealing with tricky customers and she totally gets what I am about and my bigger vision. She can be a good ear and a cheer leader when you need a pat on the back and also keeps me in check too! 
                        I can’t recommend her highly enough and thank her for all her support this far, long may it last!"</p>

                        <p>"Working with Jo has been a pleasure. Being able to outsource some of our workload, through a busy period, was so valuable. Jo is very reliable, responsive, and quick to uptake any task thrown at her. Great attention to detail allowing us to maintain our high standards of service delivery - I would highly recommend!"</p>
